 <?php require 'dist/includes/posts/post2/post-header.php' ?> <div class="post post-body"><p>Initially this blog was constructed with a "latest.pug" file which was included via pug, then I switched it over to php in order to host a database in the future with MySQL. So now I'm up and running with PHP and including that newly named "latest.php" and it works great, but I need to have only a preview of the information on the latest page that is imported into the index page.</p><p>In order to do this I've structured my files into a post system that is similar to Wordpress. Each post has a header and a body. On the "latest" page, only the page header and the "Continue Reading" link are visible, which is exactly what I want. On the page body, the header is included there before the body content, so only the post header and body are visible.</p><p>Following the header, there is "continue.php" for each post, which allows the "Continue Reading" link to be only included in the post header and not the post body. I was unable to use jQuery to simply hide or show the divs because they were dynamically included. I can imagine that there is a possible solution, but allowing the php file to be seperately included into the header allows exactly what I need.</p><p>I soon realized that I could do the same thing using Pug includes, and without a PHP server, but I'm going to focus on PHP for now so that I can use a database for a log in system for this blog (Although this live version is using pug/html).</p><div class="divider"></div><p>This file structure feels scalable for what I'm doing and I'm looking forward to making it even better as I move forward with it.</p> <?php require 'dist/includes/posts/back.php' ?> <a class="next" href="?page=post1-body">Next >></a></div>
