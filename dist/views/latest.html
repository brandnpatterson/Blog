<div class="latest"><div class="container"><div class="post"><h1>So... I've been coding!</h1><p class="date">12/18/16 10:30pm</p><h3>Over the past year, I've learned alot about how to create websites and single page applications that run on web browsers. It's been an adventure gathering resources,deciding on tools / a build system, learning industry models/trends, fundamentals of coding, and what it really takes to be a Web Developer.</h3><p>I've pursued the title of "Front End Web Developer" as I equipped myself with information. I quickly learned that involves HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, among many other tools.</p><p>The text editor I've used since I began is Atom.io and I couldn't be happier with it. I also decided to pull the trigger and invest in a Mac book Pro. I mainly did this because OS X is Unix based, and it has really suited me because I took to the terminal commands and the way files are stored quite quickly.</p><p>Alongside my hardware, I've refined a build system. Now I've probably spent more time on this than I should have, but for me a comfortable work environment is something to aspire for always.</p><p>As far as those tools, it began with package managers for me, things I knew nothing about at the beginning- Homebrew, Node, NPM. Then came Preprocessors, Bundlers, and all of the rest of those oh so helpful Task Runners. All while I did my best on Treehouse and Youtube hacking away at my completed projects.</p><p>I'm most comfortable right now with using the tools NPM Scripts, Webpack, Pug (I never used it as Jade), and Sass. I'm quite fond of the power of jQuery, but I'm also continuing to learn about the principles of Modular JavaScript, data structures and I will always be a student of the fundamentals of Computer Science.</p><p>I almost forgot to mention that I've been using Git and Github for version control locally through the terminal to push and pull versions to and from their servers as well as take advantage of their free hosting, gh-pages. I just recently found out about Surge.sh, which is another free hosting service that I like because the pages have their own page without liking to any sort of subdomain list. I feel really fortunate to have those tools for my static websites.</p><p>I've also ventured into Wordpress, PHP, and MySQL and I'm currently working on an E-commerce project using Woocommerce. The Content Management System (CMS) Wordpress is really popular and powerful. I didn't like being away from the terminal and Atom.io, but I really enjoyed learning about how PHP includes views (pages) and is harnessed by Worpress. I look forward to continuing working with Wordpress as well as building things with PHP. It amazes me how these different technologies harness routing of separate pages that then appear as one page.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xN9QxPtK2LM&amp;t=16s">Curran Kelleher</a>has an amazing tutorial about the basics of routing, which really left a strong impression on me to create single page apps with little use of frameworks to begin with in order to learn the fundamentals of how frameworks harness JavaScript in the browser and elsewhere.</p><p>With that said, I recently started a project that uses both of the frameworks Bootstrap and React, so today I wanted to build this Blog that uses neither. I'm looking forward to posting more about what I've learned over the past year, what I'm doing now, and what I am looking to do in the future!</p><h2>Happy Holidays!</h2><h3>- Brandon</h3></div></div></div>
